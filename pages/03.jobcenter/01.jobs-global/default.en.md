# Open Coop Work

OpenCoop Work Areas is a space where all participants of the FairCoop ecosystem may collaborate and build an organized workflow in a decentralized and efficient way. In addition, it includes a method of logging which is divided into tasks among people with the required skills, while distributing a certain value to everyone which contributed. This overall plan is mainly the outcome of the OpenCoop Work Summercamp 2017, where a lot of people from around the world, involved in FairCoopâ€™s ecosystem in various ways, gathered and worked on setting this up and kickstarting the new form of self-organizing the open collaborative work for the glocal FairCoop activities.
