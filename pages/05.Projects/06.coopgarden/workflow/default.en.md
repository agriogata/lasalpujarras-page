    <h4>     Beetroot</h4>
    	<ul>
            <li> Beetroot likes neutral, moist, fertile soil without too much lime or acidity (pH 6.5-7.0). </li>
            <li>The soil should be soft and not have too much clay or too much sand; however, since the root develops at the surface, a clay soil can be tolerated if the top has been loosened by the addition of lots of well-rotted organic matter (don't add this unless the soil has much clay). </li>
            <li>The position needs to be sunny and open but it will tolerate part shade. </li>

   <h4>Chili(Transplanting)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chili pepper plants can grow anywhere but they prefer sunny, warm conditions. </li> 
    <li>Test the pH of your soil and determine if you need to make further adjustments; chilies like soil that has a neutral or slightly acidic pH of 6.5-7.</li>
    <li>After the first planting, give the chilies a bit of extra water to avoid transplant shock. Then, water them on a daily basis so that the soil is damp. </li>

    <h4>Watermelon(Transplanting)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Watermelon vines are very tender and should not be transplanted until all danger of frost has passed.</li> 
    <li>Watermelons prefer a soil pH between 6 and 6.8.</li>
    <li>Keep soil moist, but not waterlogged. </li>
    <li>If you choose to fertilize (and many do), make sure it delivers more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium.</li>

    <h4>Cucumber(Transplanting)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>all they really need is plenty of water and a lot of sunlight.
</li> 
    <li>The ideal soil for cucumbers is loose, light, and sandy. This type of soil gets warmer more quickly and retains that warmth more easily.[7]</li>
    <li>Growing cucumbers vertically increases exposure to sunlight, giving you a higher yield.</li>

    <h4>Eggplant(Transplanting)</h4>
    	<ul>
            <li> Start eggplant seeds indoors 6-9 weeks before the last frost is expected.  </li>
            <li> Choose a spot in your garden that gets full sunlight. </li>
            <li> Water eggplants thoroughly once a week. </li>

        <h4>     Basil</h4>
    	<ul>
            <li> Water them. After the seeds have germinated or sprouted, it is important to spray them daily to keep the humidity levels healthy inside the container.  </li>
            <li> Wait before transplanting them. The longer you leave the basil seedlings in their container with humidity the better. Most basil seedlings will die because they are transplanted to soon. A perfect time to transplant them is when they have their third set of leaves. </li>

    <h4>     Beans</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Beans prefer warm weather and shouldnâ€™t be grown in cooler climates. These crops should be grown in sites receiving full sun in well-drained, fertilized soil.
</li> 
    <li>Preparing the soil with compost and manure before planting is highly recommended. </li>
    <li>Beans should not be planted until all danger of frost has passed, usually about a week after the last frost in spring.</li>

    <h4>     Cheackpeas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can grow chickpeas in partial shade, but doing so will dramatically decrease the eventual yield.</li>
<li>Do not plant chickpeas in areas where green manures have grown or in soils that have a high nitrogen content. Nitrogen will cause the leaves to get large and bushy, but the overall yield of the plant will end up decreasing if nitrogen levels are too high.</li>
<li> Avoid heavy clay soils or areas that are especially shady. </li>

    <h4>Garlic</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Garlic needs a lot of full sun, but it might tolerate partial shade provided it's not for very long during the day or growing season.</li>
<li>The soil must be well dug over and crumbly. Sandy loam is best.</li>
<li> Use compost and manure to add nutrients to the soil before planting the garlic.</li>
