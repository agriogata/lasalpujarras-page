    <h4>     Eggplant</h4>
    	<ul>

            <li> Water eggplants thoroughly once a week. </li>

    <h4>     Basil</h4>
    	<ul>
            <li> Water them. After the seeds have germinated or sprouted, it is important to spray them daily to keep the humidity levels healthy inside the container.  </li>
            <li> Wait before transplanting them. The longer you leave the basil seedlings in their container with humidity the better. Most basil seedlings will die because they are transplanted to soon. A perfect time to transplant them is when they have their third set of leaves. </li>

    <h4>     Cheackpeas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can grow chickpeas in partial shade, but doing so will dramatically decrease the eventual yield.</li>
<li>Do not plant chickpeas in areas where green manures have grown or in soils that have a high nitrogen content. Nitrogen will cause the leaves to get large and bushy, but the overall yield of the plant will end up decreasing if nitrogen levels are too high.</li>
<li> Avoid heavy clay soils or areas that are especially shady. </li>
