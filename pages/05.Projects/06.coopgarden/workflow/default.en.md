    <h4>     Cheackpeas</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can grow chickpeas in partial shade, but doing so will dramatically decrease the eventual yield.</li>
<li>Do not plant chickpeas in areas where green manures have grown or in soils that have a high nitrogen content. Nitrogen will cause the leaves to get large and bushy, but the overall yield of the plant will end up decreasing if nitrogen levels are too high.</li>
<li> Avoid heavy clay soils or areas that are especially shady. </li>
