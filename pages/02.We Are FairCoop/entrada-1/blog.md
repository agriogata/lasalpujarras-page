We the Assembly Foundation facilitators of [LsN; Las Alpujarras](https://hub.disroot.org/channel/lasalpujarras) wish to make the following known:

> "Most of us, live in a world not of our making but one that has been moulded over thousands of years of exploitation and injustice.
> 
> Our world is shaped by the forces of greed, capitalism and materialism, where maximum production and optimum profits are vigorously pursued, making life a misery for many and putting us and the environment at risk.
> 
> The system is ultimately controlled by the rich and powerful, the capitalists and bureaucrats, through the use of many mechanisms such as ownership of the economy (making people slaves to a job) and control of the media (creating a passive culture)." [[Source]](www.radicalroutes.org.uk/aims-and-principles.html)
> 

**LsN; Las Alpujarras  is an autonomous association of persons, united voluntarily to meet common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a _jointly-owned_ and_ democratically-controlled_ enterprise. We aim to create a network of co-operatives and individuals seeking to change this paradigm.
**
We are founded on the core values of:

*     self-help
*     self-responsibility
*     democracy
*     equality
*     equity
*     solidarity.
 
**Our members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.
**

We want to see a world based on _equality_ and _co-operation_, where people give according to their ability and receive according to their needs, where work is fullfilling and useful and creativity is encouraged, where _decision making_ is open to everyone with no hierarchies, where the _environment_ is valued and respected in its own right rather than exploited.

We want to take control over all aspects of our lives. However, as we are not all in a position of control we are forced to compromise in order to exist.

We are working towards taking control over our food, education, housing, healthcare and work through setting up housing and worker co-ops, and co-operating as a network.

Through gaining collective control over these areas we aim to reduce reliance on exploitative structures and build secure bases from which to challenge the system and encourage others to do so.


*      Principles

The following co-operative principles are guidelines, by which we put our values into practice. [[adapted]](https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles)

_1. Voluntary and Open Membership _

LsN; Las Alpujarras is a voluntary organisation, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

_2. Democratic Member Control_

We are a democratic organisation controlled by our members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. All men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperate at other levels, organising in a manner of direct democracy.

_3. Member Economic Participation_

Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of LsN; Las Alpujarras. A part of that capital is common property. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.

_4. Autonomy and Independence_

We are autonomous, self-help organisation controlled by our members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.

_5. Education, Training and Information_

We aim to provide education and training for our members, elected representatives, developers and faciliatators, to enable an effective contribution to the development of LsN; Las Alpujarras. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation.

_6. Co-operation among Co-operatives_

Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

_7. Concern for Community_

LsN; Las Alpujarras works for the sustainable development of our local communities through policies approved by our members.

*     Locations

Geographical area that encompasses the LsN Las Alpujarras

To be generally refered to, as the area "South of Granada" - while there are people who act as satellites, giving support to the node, while at the same time, acting as catalysts and seeds for the creation of nodes at other points nearby.

*     Places for group communication:

@lasalpujarras - a Telegram group, https://t.me/lasalpujarras -

We DO NOT seek to use Facebook or Twitter! - as this is proprietary CorporateWare

Instead, we use open federated social media: [@lasaplujarras@social.coop](https://social.coop/@lasalpujarras)

* Donations:

LsN; Las Alpujarras accept donations for the running costs.

Individuals and groups are welcome to support the work with single or regular contributions in any kind of currency:

* Fees:

Associated projects that seek to benefit from operating within the FairCoop network, agree to transfer a certain percentage of their fiscal benefit into the Coopfund, which will be used to fund new projects.

*     We seek to act as a catylyst for the creation of similar local nodes, including but not limited to, the revitalisation of land, resources and shared community assets throughout the Andalusia region of Spain.
*     We wish to involve as many people and groups in economic reorganisation, utilising the various tools of FairCoop.
